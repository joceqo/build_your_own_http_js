# Respond with body #cn2

A response body is used to return content to the client. This content may be an entire web page, a file, a string, or anything else that can be represented with bytes.

```

// Headers
Content-Type: text/plain\r\n  // Header that specifies the format of the response body
Content-Length: 3\r\n         // Header that specifies the size of the response body, in bytes
\r\n                          // CRLF that marks the end of the headers

// Response body
