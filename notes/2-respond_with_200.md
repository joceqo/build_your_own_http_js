## Respond to any request with 200

the first part of the response of a server is a status code.

A status code is compoese of 3 things:
- HTTP version https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/Evolution_of_HTTP 
- Status code https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status
- Optional reason phrase 

after that we have a CRLF and the headers
